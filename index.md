## Welcome, Kotliners! 

This is a group for anyone interested in Kotlin and located in Sydney, Australia. All developers welcome, regardless of their occupation: Android, backend, frontend or anything else. Meet new people, listen to interesting talks and expand your knowledge of this great language.

*In the area and want to speak? That's what the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/W5lMhsphk8OMqXVf2">call for speakers</a> form is for.*
