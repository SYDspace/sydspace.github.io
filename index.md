# Welcome, Sydneysiders!

**{{ site.title }}** is a non-profit group supporting the developer community in Sydney, Australia.

Founded by enthusiasts from the JVM community, the focus is slightly biased, but we welcome most
languages and frameworks. SYDspace volunteers organise community events and maintain open source
projects contributed to the group.

And now here's a picture of what our logo is based on, in case you were wondering.
