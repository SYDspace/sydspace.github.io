        <h1>Welcome, Serversiders!</h1>
        <p>
            Serversiders, in association with Atlassian Engineering Nights, is a community of developers working 
            on server-side applications, primarily in statically-typed languages, such as Java, Go, Kotlin, Rust 
            and others.
        </p>
        <p></p>
            Many groups focus on specific languages or frameworks. We understand that most real-world systems are 
            built with a combination of related tools, so we aim to give people working on web backends, APIs and 
            platforms a forum to discuss topics spanning multiple technologies.
