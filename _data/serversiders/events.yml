    Welcome to the first ever Serversiders meetup, in association with Atlassian Engineering Nights! 
    As you might have heard, we're a community of developers working on server-side applications, 
    primarily in statically-typed languages, such as Java, Go, Kotlin, Rust and others.
    <br/><br/>
    This month we have two talks to get the ball rolling, one about Java and another about Go. Come 
    by if that sounds interesting and hear more about the motivation behind the meetup and our future plans.

      title: Hands-on Intro to gRPC and its Scaling Pitfalls
      description: >
        We’ll spec out a basic hello service and run a server and client for it. We’ll demonstrate 
        an exercise in backwards compatibility. And then we’ll dive deep into the scaling gotchas 
        for gRPC.
