    Welcome to the first ever Serversiders meetup, in association with Atlassian Engineering Nights! 
    As you might have heard, we're a community of developers working on server-side applications, 
    primarily in statically-typed languages, such as Java, Go, Kotlin, Rust and others.
    <br/><br/>
    This month we have two talks to get the ball rolling, one about Java and another about Go. Come 
    by if that sounds interesting and hear more about the motivation behind the meetup and our future plans.

      title: Hands-on Intro to gRPC and its Scaling Pitfalls
      description: >
        We’ll spec out a basic hello service and run a server and client for it. We’ll demonstrate 
        an exercise in backwards compatibility. And then we’ll dive deep into the scaling gotchas 
        for gRPC.

      title: Hunting Bugs with AFL Fuzzing
      description: >
        Fuzzing is an automatic software testing technique especially successful when applied to software that 
        parses inputs such as JSON or XML requests or large packages of software, such as kernels. Fuzzing has 
        already found big CVEs in common software such as OpenSSL, tcpdump, ext4, bash... In this talk we will 
        explain what fuzzing consists of and how American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) works, which is one of the most used 
        fuzzers.

      title: The Journey of Scaling a Critical Backend Context Store
      description: >
        This talk covers the journey Atlassian made with its “tenant context service”, which is 
        responsible for serving things like database creds, hostname resolution and various other pieces 
        of metadata needed for all Jira / Confluence cloud requests. We’ll start with the early designs, 
        and what triggers made us evolve the design to the point we can know serve 4 billion requests per 
        day with six 9s of reliability and p99 < 1ms.

      title: Unlock Multilingual Search Using Elasticsearch
      description: >
        Is it possible, to create a search system on top of 50 languages when you can speak only 
        1-2 languages. I will share my experience and knowledge on how I used Elasticsearch to 
        create multilingual search engine.
