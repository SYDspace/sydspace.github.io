    After being away for quite a while, another new meetup focused on JVM technology, including Java, 
    Microservices, Kotlin, and much more. We hope to continue organising our meetup every 2 months, and 
    we're always looking for speakers, from beginner topics to expert levels.

      title: Fast Data Analytics in 2 Simple Steps
      description: >
        In this talk, Rahul will show how easy it is to add Hazelcast stream-processing engine to the IMDG, 
        and how to analyse data already in-memory, to pull data from outside, and to push results elsewhere.
        No-fuss coding, but blazing fast execution! All Java! The demo will be available to download afterward 
        from Github.

        Join Diego as he recalls Atlassian's journey over the last few years. Learn about the multiple 
        challenges of scaling from just a few to a thousand micro services, and the solutions that Atlassian 
        has found at each stage.

      title: How Quarkus makes Java relevant for modern programming
      description: >
        Are all your node.js friends bragging about reactive/functional programming? Bored to tears by 
        your .NET friends talking about all the new Core 3.0 libraries? Sick of your Go friends lording 
        it over you how slowly your SpringBoot server is to startup? Quarkus might be for you.
