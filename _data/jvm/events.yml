    After being away for quite a while, another new meetup focused on JVM technology, including Java, 
    Microservices, Kotlin, and much more. We hope to continue organising our meetup every 2 months, and 
    we're always looking for speakers, from beginner topics to expert levels.

      title: Fast Data Analytics in 2 Simple Steps
      description: >
        In this talk, Rahul will show how easy it is to add Hazelcast stream-processing engine to the IMDG, 
        and how to analyse data already in-memory, to pull data from outside, and to push results elsewhere.
        No-fuss coding, but blazing fast execution! All Java! The demo will be available to download afterward 
        from Github.
