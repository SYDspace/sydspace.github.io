    The interest in Kotlin has been growing steadily for the past couple of years, so having done 
    a few talks as part of the Android meetup, we decided to host a separate event dedicated 
    entirely to Kotlin. Luckily for us, the VP of Developer Advocacy at JetBrains is coming to 
    town and we invited him to give a talk. Come along if you’re interested in Kotlin, there 
    will be interesting talks, pizza, beer and some giveaways.

      title: A deeper dive into Kotlin
      description: >
        In this talk we're going to dive a bit deeper into some powerful aspects of Kotlin that 
        provide us with great functionality. We're going to cover topics such as delegation, 
        higher-order extension functions, inline and reified functions, and some other features 
        that allow us to create DSL for using in our applications. In addition we'll look at some 
        of the new things coming out in Kotlin 1.1, and in particular Coroutines, Type Aliases,
        Local Delegation Properties and Inline Properties.

      title: Asynchronous Vert.x Applications in Kotlin
      description: >
        Looking at web development, Spring seems to be the star of most Kotlin articles and 
        tutorials. This talk will explore an asynchronous alternative that is Vert.x and evaluate 
        its production readiness. We’ll do that by writing a simple (but working) web API, with 
        some neat Kotlin features to boot, and figure out what the benefits of using this 
        framework are.

      title: "Fantastic DSLs and where to find them"
      description: >
        Kotlin is a very rich language. Unlike many other languages, it allows building another 
        language inside itself. For example, mimic HTML syntax or construct completely typed SQL 
        query. But Kotlin’s power isn’t limited to simple DSLs. With some Kotlin-fu, it’s 
        possible to write a DSL that allows working on untyped data structures in a typed manner.   
        In this talk, we’ll go through different ways to define a DSL in Kotlin, from very simple 
        to fantastically powerful.

      title: "A 100% Kotlin on Android"
      description: >
        In this talk we will look at the lessons learned from writing an Android app completely in 
        Kotlin. We will look at the advantages and disadvantages of using Kotlin and how it plays 
        with other technologies used, like RxJava & Realm.
